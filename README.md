This is my submission for the Junior position.

Using Ruby on Rails and jQuery, I have managed to create a very basic web app which performs all tasks required by the criteria, except for pagination. Search functionality is acheived by using jQuery Mobile's filter search functionality. Although basic, this app should work well on either a tablet or a desktop/laptop computer. Testing has also been implemented after learning of tools already included within Rails - with this in mind, I created a new app and opted to use Minitest for the sake of keeping the application streamlined.
